#Fundamental Data Types

print(2 + 4)
print(type(2 + 4))
print(type(2 / 4)) #0.5 = float

#Adding 2 floating numbers together that equal an interger still
#saves as a float ex 9.9 + 1.1

print(2 ** 3) # = 8 (2x2x2)
print(5 // 4) # = 1 (how many times can 4 go into 5)
print(6 % 4) # = 2 (What is left after I take 4 out of 6)

#Math Functions

print(round(3.1)) #rounding a number up or down
print(abs(-20)) #absolute value of a number, no negatives

print(bin(5)) #binary number for 5
print(int('0b101', 2)) #converts a binary number into an integer

print(iq)

user_age = iq / 4

a,b,c = 1,2,3 #easy way to assign multiple variables

#constants
PI = 3.14 # full capital variable names means it is a constant, won't change
